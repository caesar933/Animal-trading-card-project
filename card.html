                <p>A well-conditioned Boxer is an awesome sight. Their muscles ripple beneath their short, tight-fitting coat. The dark brown eyes and wrinkled forehead give the face an alert, curious look. Boxers move like the athletes theyâ€™re named for: smooth and graceful, but powerful. The coat can be fawn (tan to mahogany-red) or brindle (kind of like tiger stripes), with white markings.<br>You can only to love them!</p>
